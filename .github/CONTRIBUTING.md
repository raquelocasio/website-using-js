# Welcome to contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected :sparkles:.

## New contributor guide
To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Search in Issues](https://github.com/scorcism/website-using-js/issues)
- [Create your one if needed](https://github.com/scorcism/website-using-js/issues)
- [Have a look into the issue sections](https://github.com/scorcism/website-using-js/issues)

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/scorcism/website-using-js/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/scorcism/website-using-js/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/scorcism/website-using-js/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.


### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review.

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Use `liveserver` if you are using vscode

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one. `write issue number` if you are solving any.
- Enable the checkbox to `allow maintainer edits` so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, we will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using `suggested changes` or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as `resolved`
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
